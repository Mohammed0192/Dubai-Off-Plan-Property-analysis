# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Across Dubai overall, hotels have remained the most expensive off-plan property purchases despite having the largest percentage decrease in average price (per square mile) in the last 3 years. There has been an apparent increase in the prices of OPP shops (per square mile) being purchased across Dubai also. Post-COVID, the average price of OPP flats has decreased but flats in the Mina Seyahi and Jumeirah Beach region have enjoyed noticeable price hikes. Another post-COVID trend are falling OPP office prices across Dubai, perhaps reflecting the post-COVID desire for workers to WFH?

# Insights Deep Dive
### **Confidence in downtown Dubai Area OPP flats :**:

* **OPP Flats in Dubai area remain in high demand:**  A high purchase rate for OPP Flats in downtown Dubai and high prices suggests market confidence in that area. 
  
* **OPP Flats in Marina and Mirdiff attempting to keep up:**  OPP flat prices in Marina and Mirdiff increased yet purchases remain low. This reflects investors trying to keep prices up to attract high-earning buyers which hasn't worked, leading to a drop in prices and sales after 2022.

### Flats over Hotels in downtown areas:

* **OPP Hotels becoming less popular and less centralised.** Less Hotel purchases in downtown Dubai (near Dubai Mall) and prices are more competitive near Al Barsha and Al-Kasir over time.
  
* **Flats are more popular across Dubai.** OPP flats are becoming increasingly popular over time especially in downtown areas but also across Dubai (e.g. other malls like Ibn Battuta and Mirdif) .

### Office properties are in less demand post-COVID:

* **Office properties were unpopular pre-COVID.** Across Dubai, some OPP Office purchases have simply stopped (e.g. near Ibn Battuta Mall). But this was exacerbated post-COVID where we see number of Offices in downtown Dubai (near Dubai Mall) match surrounding areas.
  
* **Growing Office Prices in Marina** This fits the overall trend of increased property prices in Marina/Al-Kasir area

### Growing popularity for Shop properties in Jebel Ali Village (IB Mall):

* **Jebel Ali Village competitive space for OPP Shops.** OPP Shop prices near IB Mall have increased noticeably since 2021 yet the number of OPP shop purchases have remained low in that area. Higher prices with limited supply could indicate  investors confidence in the areaâ€™s growth potential or high competition in urban areas where land costs are high.
  
* **OPP Shops are cheaper in Al-Kasir (near Marina Mall).** This reflects the popularity of Al-Kasir that the number of OPP shop purchases have increased in this area, causing a drop in OPP shop prices since 2019.  Demand for OPP shops in al-Kasir is present, but only at more affordable levels.

# Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend a property startup company to consider the following: 

* Flats near iconic landmarks are being favoured over Hotels particularly in Downtown Dubai. **Focus on Downtown Flats and High-Demand Areas.**
  
* In al-Marina OPP shops have seen increased purchases at lower prices. **Capitalize on the Growing Popularity of OPP Shops in Jebel Ali and Marina.**
  
* Low demand and declining OPP Office prices across Dubai. **Shift Away from Office Spaces and Focus on Flats.**
  
* Clear competition in established urban areas, but areas like Jebel Ali show promise for growth. **Focus on off-plan shops that cater to both local residents and international visitors, as these areas are likely to see infrastructure and retail growth.**

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Correct translations: the data set was in Arabic so currency is assumed to be in AED not Dollars
  
* Incomplete data: 2023 data is cut short because it was collected and stopped midway in the year
